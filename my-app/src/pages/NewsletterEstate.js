          <h1 className="estate-main-title">Why Estate Planning Matters in India?</h1>
          
          <div className="estate-intro">
            <p>Did you know? Over ₹88,000 crore worth of assets in India lie unclaimed, simply because people didn't plan their succession right.</p>
            
            <p>Estate planning and will writing aren't just for the wealthy; they're essential for every Indian family. Without them, legacies risk being lost to disputes, delays, and the system.</p>
            
            <p>The recent Investza webinar featuring Mr. Jatin Popat, founder of WillJini, reinforced how modern estate planning is the key to protecting your family's future in an ever-changing legal and financial landscape.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="estate-key-facts">
            <p>Estate planning is not just for the wealthy; it ensures that assets are managed, distributed, and protected according to your wishes, regardless of your wealth or background. Without a valid will or estate plan, your property can become entangled in lengthy legal battles and probate delays, especially given that Indian courts have over 3.7 crore pending cases, many related to property disputes.</p>
            
            <p>A staggering statistic highlights the urgency: only about 2–3% of Indians have written a will, yet over ₹50,000 crore remains unclaimed in banks and financial institutions due to missing wills and unplanned successions. Moreover, as India prepares for a $44.8 trillion wealth transfer in the coming decades, a robust estate plan is essential for smooth intergenerational wealth transmission.</p>

          <h2 className="estate-section-title">Common Challenges and Myths</h2>
          
          <p>Many Indians assume that asset transfer will occur smoothly to their family by default, especially after listing nominees, but nominees are only caretakers—not legal heirs. Actual asset inheritance is dictated by personal laws and the Indian Succession Act, often leading to unintended beneficiaries. Additionally, taboos around discussing death or inheritance keep families from planning proactively, inviting costly and emotional disputes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Common myths debunked by experts:</strong></p>
          <ul className="estate-list">
            <li>Estate planning is only for the elderly or the rich.</li>
            <li>Writing a will is complex, expensive, or should be done only when one is ill.</li>
            <li>Nominees automatically become heirs and can access assets freely.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="estate-subsection-title">Benefits of Effective Estate Planning</h3>
          
          <p>A comprehensive estate plan provides:</p>
          <ul className="estate-list">
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Everyone in the family knows the 'why' and 'how' behind asset distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Family trusts and councils preserve the legacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> The individual decides asset flow, values, and succession rules.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Key benefits include:</strong></p>
          <ul className="estate-list">
            <li>Asset protection for beneficiaries</li>

          <h2 className="estate-section-title">What Should Every Indian Do Next?</h2>
          
          <p>Estate planning is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Families should review their estate plans every 3 years or after a major change (marriage, childbirth, inheritance, new assets, etc.). Consult with professionals and use trusted digital platforms to keep documents up-to-date.</p>
          
          <ul className="estate-list">
            <li>Start by assessing all assets (property, investments, insurance, digital assets).</li>
            <li>Define your goals (security for family, tax minimization, smooth transfer).</li>
            <li>Consult experts for legally valid documents (wills, trusts, powers of attorney).</li>
            <li>Update your plan regularly as circumstances change.</li>
          </ul>
